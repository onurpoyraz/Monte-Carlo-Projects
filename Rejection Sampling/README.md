# Rejection-Sampling

Assignment 1

Estimate pi by rejection sampling

Create a jupyter notebook that shows the estimate of pi using rejection sampling. Generate samples uniformly on a unit square and accept if they fall within the unit circle.

Use $N = 100,1000,10000 $ samples for each estimate, repeat each experiment 10 times and estimate the mean and the variance of the Monte Carlo estimator.
